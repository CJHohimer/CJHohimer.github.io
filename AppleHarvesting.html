        <h1>Robotic Apple Harvesting</h1>
        <p>During my Ph.D. a portion of my project was in applying soft-robotics combined with traditional robotic to
            unstructured environments. To do this we designed a low cost 3-DOF robotic arm with a 3d-printed
            soft-robotic manipulator in order to harvest fresh market apples in a commercial orchard in Washington. In
            this unstructured outdoor environment, we were able to achieve reasonable picking times with minimal fruit
            damage and make clear recommendations on further pruning techniques to ensure successful robotic harvesting
            moving forward. </p>



        <p>Fresh market apple harvesting is a difficult task that relies entirely on manual labor. Much research has
            been done on the development of mechanical harvesting techniques. Several selective harvesting robots have
            been developed for research studies, but there are no commercially available robotic systems. This article
            discusses the design and development of a novel pneumatic 3D-printed soft-robotic end-effector to facilitate
            apple separation. The end-effector was integrated into a robotic system with five degrees of freedom that
            was designed to simplify the picking sequence and reduce costs compared to previous versions. Apples were
            successfully harvested using the low-cost robotic system in a commercial orchard during the fall 2017
            harvest. A detachment success rate on attempted apples of 67% was achieved, with an average time of 7.3 s
            per fruit from separation to the storage bin. By conducting this study in an orchard where problematic
            apples were not removed to increase the detachment success rate, current pruning, and thinning practices
            were assessed to help lay the foundation for future studies and develop strategies for successfully
            harvesting apples that are difficult to detach.</p>

        </div>


        <p>The end effect that I designed used fairly standard inflatable bellows actuators to grasp the fruit from the
            tree while minimizing damage to the tree and apples because of the compliant nature while not inflated. The
            use of these inflatable fingers greatly improved the reliability of grasping over previous cable driving
            compliant fingers.

        </div>



        <p>An FEA model was also implemented based on the printed TPU properties to aid in the bellows design. At the
            time only a limited number of FDM printed actuators were in development and this work really showcased how
            the printing technology could be used to fabricate this class of actuator without more complex or
            time-intensive casting methods. It also allows for the use of thermoplastics with better abrasion and
            puncture resistance. This is especially important when interacting with the orchard environment where tree
            branches and guide wires become hazardous to the end-effector. </p>

            <P>This project is no longer active but some of the arm control code can be found <a href="https://github.com/CJHohimer/ArmOnly-Code/tree/master/ArmOnly">here</a>.</P>
