        <h1>Soft Robotic Glove</h1>
        <p>While in the Biodesign lab I worked to develop a robotic glove to aid in stroke rehabilitation. As part of
            that effort I worked with a Functional Apparel Designer and Occupational Therapist to assess a wearable
            robotic glove on stroke survivors as a rehabilitation tool. In this effort we looked at existing technology
            within the lab to create a unique device for stroke recovery. My job was to help design the soft robotic
            actuators to overcome the challenge unique to stroke spasticity and improve their function over the previous
            versions for spinal cord injury survivors. This was a coordinated effort with the functional apparel
            designer to make the device truly wearable and functional.
            Additionally, I was tasked with developing the control strategies needed for early clinical testing in the
            motion capture lab. Working with the Occupational Therapist to understand the best rehabilitation practices
            of current care and translate that into a robotic controlled session that is both effective and safe for
            participants.

        <p>Hand function rehabilitation is one of the most important aspects to improve the quality of life and
            independencefor stroke survivors. Access to therapy is a key factor in one’sability to perform
            rehabilitation exercises and recover motorfunction. The aim of this research is to show the viability
            ofusing a soft robotic glove to perform home-based rehabilitationof the hand function of stroke survivors.
            Soft wearable roboticdevices are a promising approach to hand rehabilitation dueto their lightweight,
            compliant, and low-cost design. The goalof this wearable technology is to reduce hyperexcitability ofthe
            flexor muscles through cyclic stretching of the fingers,active-assisted exercise, and task-oriented
            training. In thispilot study, four chronic stroke survivors were provided 300repetitions of opening and
            closing their hand with the softrobotic glove over 6 training sessions. This high-intensity, high-repetition
            protocol was found to be safe and well-tolerated byall subjects. Results demonstrated average increases of
            18.5°and 17.3° in the relaxed metacarpophalangeal and proximalinterphalangeal joint angles, respectively, of
            the index fingerand an average increase of 33 Newtons in grip strength. Thiswork motivates further
            development of this home-based softrobotic rehabilitation device and lays the groundwork for alonger term
            study.</p>
