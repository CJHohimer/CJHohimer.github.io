                <p>
                    I am currently a Research Associate in the Biodesign Lab under the direction of Conor Walsh. My
                    research
                    interests include soft-robotics, wearables, exosuits, machine design.
                    With my own lab, I hope to bridge the game between material science and manufacturing, and wearable
                    robotics technology.
                    I want to explore new ways to create functional robots for unstructured environments and wearable
                    technology to interact with these robots to enhance human performance.
                    On this site, you will find a variety of research and personal projects that I have worked on and
                    found
                    interesting.</p>

                <p> When I am not in the lab I enjoy as much of the great outdoors as I can. I enjoy hiking, camping,
                    all
                    types of boating. I also enjoy riding my bike for both commuting and weekend touring.
                    Sport lockpicking is also a hobby I recently picked up during the 2020 shutdown.
                    I enjoying practicing my picking skills while watching Netflix with my wife, Katie. I am no
                    locksmith
                    (yet), but I can open many of the padlocks and simple cylinders in my collection.
                </P>
                <p> Prior to my academic career I spent six years in the US Navy. In that I made two deployments to the
                    middle east as a combat coxswain/radio operator, and a joint terminal attack controller. I enjoyed
                    the
                    work but decided there were other things in life I wanted to pursue. I was honorably discharged in
                    September of 2009.

                    I also love all things train-related. My grandfather was a huge train enthusiast and past along both
                    his
                    love of mechanical engineering as well as model trains. As I kid I would enjoy my summers riding his
                    large scale garden train around his property on the track around his house. I look forward to the
                    day I
                    can emulate this at my own house and restore my steam locomotive to its glory days.
