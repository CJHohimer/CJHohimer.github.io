        <h2>Teaching Experiance</h2>
        <p>In the summer of 2018, I was hired as an adjunct professor at WSU to teach Mechatronics. I had been a TA for
            the course many times before but this gave me an opportunity to develop my own syllabus, lecture material,
            and lab assignments. It was challenging having never taught a course on my own but a very rewarding
            experience and help me realize how much I enjoy teaching. It helped me appreciate the level of effort required
            to teach a course well, even with a strong understanding of the course material.</p>



        <p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong></p>



        <ul>
            <li>Understanding the design of electromechanical systems controlled by µ-processors</li>
            <li>Understanding the use of actuators and sensors</li>
            <li>Understanding the use and manipulation of signal conditioning circuitry</li>
            <li>Understanding of LabVIEW programming</li>
            <li>Understanding of PLC’s and their programming</li>
        </ul>



        <p>The course consisted of weekly lectures and 10 laboratory projects, the final exam being a small group
            project to showcase the different learning outcomes of the weekly labs. Many of the students enjoyed this
            hands-on learning approach and set very high expectations for their final projects. A few example clips are
            highlighted here. It was a very rewarding experiance to see the students take charge of their education and
            empower them to complete these complex tasks. </p>

                    style="width:500px;height:auto;"></video></figure>
        </div>


        <p>One of the more creative projects was to create a pair of robots to shoot a simulated basketball free-throw
            and deliver the rebound. The student ambition and high expectations paid off in the end with
            a successful final demo. </p>



        <p>Another highlighted project showcased a tuned PID loop to keep an inverted pendulum robot upright. The
            students were able to successfully develop control code to keep the robot from falling over even with some outside disturbances. </p>
